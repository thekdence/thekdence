I break things to learn. I build tools to make it faster. I write everything down so I don’t forget how I did it. I’m learning penetration testing from the ground up and showing the work as I go.

## What I’m Working On

- **CTF Writeups**  
  Step-by-step notes from TryHackMe boxes. Each one documents how I got in, what I found, how I escalated, and what I learned.

- **Pentest Cheat Sheets**  
  The commands I use and the tricks I rely on. No filler. Just what works when I need it fast.

- **Python Tools**  
  Scripts I wrote for recon, scraping, automation, and anything else that saves time. Some are security focused. Some just solve problems.

## What I Know

- I understand the basics of Linux privilege escalation. I know how to enumerate, search for SUID binaries, and run linpeas.
- I can break down web services using GoBuster, FFUF, Nikto, and manual testing. I know what to look for in forms, headers, and file uploads.
- I’ve written tools in Python to run scans, clean data, and scrape the web. I can write my own scripts or modify others without relying on tutorials.
- I keep my work organized. Every script, every CTF, every lesson learned is written down.

## What I Want

A real chance. A role where I can apply what I’ve built and keep learning. I don’t expect to walk in as an expert. I expect to show up, figure it out, and get better every day.

I’m not looking to be handheld. I’m looking to be useful.
